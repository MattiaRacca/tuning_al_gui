# tuning_al_gui: Active Learning tuning for EUPanda

This repository contains the code behind the Active Learning tuning approach
presented in \[[1]\].

While the Active Learning approach is standalone (contained in `src/range_al`), its
implementation for the Franka Panda robot and related tuning GUI depends on
[EUPanda], my ROS-based end-user programming framework.
